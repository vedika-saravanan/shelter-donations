  ------------
  Entry HTML file for the Shelter Donations React + Vite frontend.

  Purpose:
  - Serves as the main document loaded by the browser.
  - Defines a root element (`#root`) where the React app is mounted.
  - Loads the React entry point script (`main.tsx`).

  Notes:
  - This file is processed and optimized by Vite during build.
  - Keep external JS references minimal; most dependencies are bundled.
